### Lecture 3: Libraries and Compilers to build ZKP

- This was a more hands-on lecture with live coding. So, I don't have notes for this.
- You can watch the [lecture video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpRSaG6iuks) itself.
- And read the following docs:
  - [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/)
  - Wouldn't suggest reading Arkworks and ZoKrates docs. I believe they are not in active development.
